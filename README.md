This is a C# Wargame system, unoffically based on the Phoenix Command Ruleset that was published by Leading Edge Games (1980s).

This contains a implemention of the ruleset , no graphics just a libary.  This is a probably best known as ultra complex , very detailed damage system

Based on Cold War weapons and equipment - as the present moment it covers rifles and pistols.  Hopefullly will be able to add shotguns , burst fire , grenades

The Library itself uses a few localDB to hold data , if you use the library you'll need to inculde the whole of the build plus DBs

If you run into any error or if you see any improvements/suggestions please feel feel to raise a Issue or a Pull Request if you've done the work.
